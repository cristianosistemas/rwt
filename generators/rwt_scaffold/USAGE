Description:
    Scaffolds an entire resource, from model and migration to controller and
    views, along with a full test suite, just like the standard Rails scaffold
    generator. The rwt_scaffold generator uses the Ext Javascript framework to
    build the GUI elements (forms and tables).

    Pass the name of the model, either CamelCased or under_scored, as the first
    argument, and an optional list of attribute pairs.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. Timestamps are added by default, so you don't have to
    specify them by hand as 'created_at:datetime updated_at:datetime'.

    For example, `rwt_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    gives you a model with those three attributes, a controller that handles
    the create/show/update/destroy, Ext forms to create and edit your posts, and
    an Ext Grid index that lists them all, as well as a map.resources :posts
    declaration in config/routes.rb.

Prerequisites:
		You need to download the Ext Javascript framework from

		`http://extjs.com/download`,

		and unzip it into `#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/ext`. Rwt_scaffold was
		tested against version 3.0.0 of the Ext framework.

Examples:
    `./script/generate rwt_scaffold post` # no attributes, view will be anemic
    `./script/generate rwt_scaffold post title:string body:text published:boolean`
    `./script/generate rwt_scaffold purchase order_id:integer amount:decimal`
